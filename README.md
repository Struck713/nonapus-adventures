# Nonapus Adventures
This repository contains all of the code and information for [Dr. DeLozier's](https://www.kent.edu/cs/global-circ/dr-gregory-delozier-progressive-insurance) Software Engineering class at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/). 

## Game Plan
We're going to build a 2D roguelike (like the [Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)). If we abstract away the entire idea, it is quite simply:
- ~~A maze~~
- ~~A character stuck in that maze~~
- ~~Some enemies (probably with some pathing and AI)~~
- ~~A boss (or a couple of bosses)~~
- A story (??)
- An ending (??)
- music
- ~~sound effects~~
- ~~art~~
